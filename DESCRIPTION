Description: Assesses the statistical power of an alignment to discriminate
    among phylogenetic mixture models with different numbers of rate or profile
    categories (K), using a parametric bootstrap framework built around IQ-TREE.
    For a user-specified range of K, kpower fits each model to the empirical
    data, simulates replicate alignments from the best-fitting model via AliSim,
    refits all K values on each replicate, and compares the resulting information
    criterion profiles to those from the empirical data. Output includes an
    empirical power estimate and a publication-ready figure.
